# Digital Crumple V1 - Claude Code Implementation Plan

## 🎯 **Project Overview**
Build a therapeutic web application where users can write their thoughts on virtual paper and then watch it realistically crumble with satisfying animations. This is a Level 3 client-side app focusing on stress relief and emotional catharsis.

## 🏗️ **V1 Core Features (MVP)**

### **1. Full-Screen Writing Experience**
- Full viewport paper canvas with realistic texture
- Invisible textarea overlay covering entire screen
- Placeholder text as subtle instructions ("Write your thoughts here...")
- Typewriter/monospace font for authentic writing feel
- Text appears directly on paper texture
- Auto-hide placeholder on first keystroke

### **2. Minimal UI Design**
- Pure black and white aesthetic
- No visible borders, buttons, or chrome
- Clean typography and spacing
- Subtle paper texture (light gray grain on white)
- Focus on content, not interface

### **3. Paper Crumple Animation**
- Single floating "Crumple" button overlay at bottom center
- Button appears only when text is present
- Multi-stage CSS transform animation:
  - Stage 1: Paper folds appear (0.5s)
  - Stage 2: Paper contracts and rotates (1s)  
  - Stage 3: Forms crumpled ball (0.5s)
  - Stage 4: Ball disappears with fade (0.3s)
- Random rotation values for unique crumples
- Satisfying easing curves (ease-out, bounce)

### **4. Clean Interactions**
- Click anywhere to start typing
- Escape key to clear all text
- Smooth focus states without visual clutter
- Mobile touch support optimized for typing
- Responsive design (mobile + desktop)

### **5. Visual Polish**
- Subtle paper texture and minimal shadows
- Smooth transitions for all states
- Clean, distraction-free experience
- High contrast for accessibility

.paper-scrunch { transition: transform 1s ease-in-out; }
.paper-ball    { transition: all 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55); }
.paper-fade    { transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in; }
```

## 💻 **Implementation Steps**

### **Phase 1: Full-Screen Canvas (Day 1)**
1. Create HTML with full-viewport textarea overlay
2. Implement subtle paper texture using Canvas/CSS
3. Style textarea to be invisible but functional
4. Add placeholder text with smooth transitions
5. Test full-screen typing experience on mobile/desktop

### **Phase 2: Core Animation (Day 1-2)**
1. Build multi-stage CSS crumple animation for entire viewport
2. Add random rotation/transform values for uniqueness
3. Implement smooth transition timing with satisfying easing
4. Test animation performance (60fps target)
5. Add animation reset functionality

### **Phase 3: Minimal UI & Interactions (Day 2)**
1. Create floating crumple button (appears only with text)
2. Add keyboard shortcuts (ESC to clear)
3. Implement focus states and accessibility
4. Perfect mobile touch interactions
5. Cross-browser compatibility testing

### **Phase 4: Polish & Optimization (Day 2-3)**
1. Fine-tune paper texture subtlety
2. Optimize animation performance
3. Add loading states (minimal)

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Canvas Paper Texture Generator**
```javascript
class MinimalPaperTexture {
  generateTexture() {
    const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    
    // Generate subtle paper grain (very light)
    // Black and white only with minimal contrast
    // Return as CSS background-image for body
  }
}
```

### **Full-Screen Textarea Controller**
```javascript
class FullScreenWriter {
  constructor() {
    this.textarea = document.getElementById('writing-area');
    this.button = document.getElementById('crumple-btn');
    this.setupEvents();
  }
  
  setupEvents() {
    // Show/hide button based on text content
    // Handle placeholder text transitions
    // Manage full-screen writing experience
  }
}
```

### **Crumple Animation Controller**
```javascript
class CrumpleAnimator {
  constructor(containerElement) {
    this.container = containerElement;
    this.isAnimating = false;
  }
  
  async crumple() {
    if (this.isAnimating) return;
    
    // Animate entire viewport as paper
    await this.foldPhase();
    await this.scrunchPhase(); 
    await this.ballPhase();
    await this.fadePhase();
    this.reset();
  }
}
```

## 🚀 **Getting Started with Claude Code**

### **Initial Prompt for Claude Code**
```
I want to build a minimal therapeutic "Digital Crumple" web application where users can write their thoughts on a full-screen virtual paper and then watch the entire screen crumble with satisfying animations.

V1 Features needed:
1. Full-screen paper texture background (subtle, black and white only)
2. Invisible textarea covering entire viewport with placeholder instructions
3. Floating "Crumple" button at bottom (appears only when text is present)
4. Multi-stage CSS crumple animation for entire viewport (fold → scrunch → ball → fade)
5. Minimal black and white aesthetic - no colors, no audio
6. Mobile-responsive with touch support

Technical requirements:
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks, no audio)
- Client-side only implementation
- 60fps animation performance target
- Full-screen immersive writing experience
- High contrast accessibility
- Privacy-first (no data storage)

Design aesthetic:
- Clean minimal black and white only
- Typewriter/monospace font for writing
- Subtle paper texture (very light)
- No visible UI except floating crumple button
- Focus on distraction-free writing experience

Please create the initial file structure and implement the full-screen paper texture with textarea overlay first.
```

### **File Creation Order**
1. `index.html` - Full-screen HTML structure
2. `styles/main.css` - Minimal layout and base styles
3. `styles/paper.css` - Subtle paper texture styling
4. `scripts/paper-texture.js` - Canvas texture generation
5. `scripts/main.js` - Core application logic
6. `styles/animations.css` - Full-screen crumple animation keyframes
7. `scripts/paper-physics.js` - Animation controllers

## 🎉 **Next Steps After V1**

### **V2 Enhancements (Future)**
- Multiple paper types (lined, graph, parchment)
- Throw animation with physics
- Particle effects on crumple
- Mood-based color changes
- Uncrumple animation (reverse)
- Ambient background sounds

### **V3 Advanced Features (Future)**  
- WebGL paper physics simulation
- Advanced gesture recognition
- Custom paper textures
- Haptic feedback patterns
- Progressive Web App features
- Offline functionality

## ✅ **Ready to Start Building!**

This plan provides everything needed to start vibecoding with Claude Code. The V1 focuses on core therapeutic value with satisfying animations while maintaining technical simplicity and client-side privacy.

**Key Success Factor**: Focus on the *feeling* of satisfaction and cathartic release rather than technical complexity. The animation timing, audio synchronization, and visual polish are more important than advanced physics.
